# Project Title
Checkout.com

## About The App
This is a technical test for Checkout.com

When a user fills out the feedback form and submits it, the results of that form are shown in the result form. I decided to display only the latest 10 comments in the comments section, and add the latest comment on the top.

## Technologies
In this project I used React, Typecript, Redux toolkit to manage state, Tailwind.css to add styling, yup to validate a form, Chart.js to show the rating from a feedback form.

## Setup
- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start` to start the project
- run `npm test` to run tests
